=======

## Purpose

The goal behind this project is to develop a teaching tool for Dr. Bekkering's Database Systems class. This progam is designed to show how the different searching and sorting methods work is a visual space in order to better help students understand and digest how exactly they work.

## Functionality

This program is equiped to import a .txt file with numbers from 0 to 999 seperated by line breaks, with a max capacity of 144 values, into the program. The program is currently capable of loading the values into the cells and mixing up the loaded cell values, as well as the following method animation.

_Sort Functions:_

    * Bubble
    * Insertion
    * Quick
    * Selection
    
_Search Function:_

    * Binary
    * Interpolation
    * Linear
    
The speed of the animation is adjustable via the slider bar in the lower right corner and a pause button is available should the animation need to be paused momentarily.

The program ultilizes color to mark or higlight certain cells. A deep blue or light yellow are used to signify that the method is marking that cell position as important or looking directly at that cell respectively. In search funtions, correct cells are recolored green while wrong cells are recolored red. Ignored cells are recolored dark gray signifying the method has skipped over them or the program has moved on to another cells and is done with that cell for the moment.
